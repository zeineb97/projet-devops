"""
The Web Server Gateway Interface:a simple calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications or frameworks written in the Python programming language. 
It describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request. 
It is used to forward requests from a web server (such as Apache or NGINX) to a backend Python web application or framework. 
From there, responses are then passed back to the web server to reply to the requestor.
Requests are sent from the clientâ€™s browser to the server.
